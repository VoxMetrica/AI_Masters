The files here relate to the final assignment of the principles of programming module of my AI online MSc.
The assignment asks us to create a working simulcra of the enigma machine and use it to crack codes.
An advanced section asks us to create an extension to the exercise. I create a more advanced simulcra of the Enigma machine which would have resisted the code breaking at Bletchly Park.
